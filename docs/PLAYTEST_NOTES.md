# Playtest tuning notes

Small, living notes on tuning knobs that only reveal their feel in play. Each
names the config path, the current default, and what to watch for.

## Core governance (`aliens.governance`, WP51/WP52)

- **`seizure_chance`** (default `0.002`/day). The background probability that a
  ready `covets_core` bloc seizes the Core on the daily `governance_tick`. A
  seizure only *rolls* once the bloc is `npc_seizure_ready` — its own
  home-cluster bases intact **and** the incumbent's operational Core-planet
  bases below `min_incumbent_bases`. So the rate is not "flips per day" but
  "flips per day *while the Core is already destabilized*". Watch: if a Core
  weakened by raids/player razing sits contested for many in-game days without
  resolving, raise it toward `0.005`; if flips feel arbitrary (player never
  saw the Core weaken first), the gate — not the chance — is the lever.
- **`intrigue_chance`** (default `0.001`/day). Leadership coups inside a bloc.
  Independent of the Core state; a coup only *turns outward* if
  `intrigue_turns_outward` is set on the bloc. Keep well below `seizure_chance`
  so coups are rare colour, not a constant churn of dossier text.
- **`min_incumbent_bases`** (default per roster). The destabilization gate. This
  is what makes a flip feel *earned* rather than random — the number of Core
  bases that must fall first. Tune this before the chances.

Devtool: `python -m edge.devtool governance` reports the live governor, the
incumbent's operational Core-base count, and each `covets_core` bloc's
seizure-readiness — the fastest way to see whether the gate is open.
`python -m edge.devtool flip_governor <alliance_id>` forces a flip (0 =
ungoverned) to exercise the aftermath surfacing directly.
